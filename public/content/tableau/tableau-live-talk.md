# Tableau Live Presentation

- Today's session will only connect using Excel, but the beauty of the application is that is can connect to many different data sources and integrate with many applications.
- Tableau server is where you can go to get insights and collaborate. There is also permission enablement for sharing.
- Sidebar (of course) is for navigation.
- Visualisation can be easily done by comparing tables and moving it around for visualisations that are being created in real time.
