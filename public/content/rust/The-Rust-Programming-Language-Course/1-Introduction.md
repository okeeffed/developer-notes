## Rust Intro

Rust compiles to either binary or web assembly.

## Why not use Rust?

- Rust is a big language. Lots to learn!
- Smaller ecosystem than C/C++ (but FFI - foreign function interface).
- Slower iteration cycle than most languages.
- Strict compiler. Very reliable, but can be a lot of problems.
- Satisfying the borrow checker is tough.
- Slow compile times for full builds.
- Tests can take awhile to build.

Safer than C++, less safe than e.g. pure FP.
