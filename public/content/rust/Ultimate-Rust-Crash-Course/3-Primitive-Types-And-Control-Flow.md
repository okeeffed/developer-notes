# 3: Primitive Types and Control Flow

## Control Flow

The condition MUST evaluate to a boolean.

```rs
if num == 5 {
	msg = "five";
} else if num == 4 {
	msg = "four";
} else {
	msg = "other";
}
```

You can also assign a variable to the result of the condition. Note: you must use tail expressions in this case.

```rs
let msg = if num == 5 {
	"five"
} else if num == 4 {
	"four"
} else {
	"other"
};
```

Ternaries in Rust can be written like so:

```rs
num = if a { b } else { c };
```

There is also an unconditional loop:

```rs
loop {
	println!("Hello, world!");
}
```

You can even break out of a deep-nested loop with `break` and naming.

```rs
'bob: loop {
	'joe: loop {
		break 'bob;
	}
}
```

A similar thing can be done with `continue`.

While loops are also very similar to other languages, but there are no `do` blocks.

```rs
while dizzy() {
	// do stuff
}
```

Rust also has ways to iterate through an iterator. It can even take a pattern or work through a range.

```rs
// iterate in order
for num in [7,8,9].iter() {
	println!("{}", num);
}

// iterate with a pattern
let array = [(1,2), (3,4)];
for (x,y) in array.iter() {
	println!("{} {}", x, y);
}

// For ranges -> note the end here is exclusive
for num in 0..50 {
	println!("{}", num);
}

// This range includes the end
for num in 0..=50 {
	if num % 2 == 0 {
		println!("{}", num);
	}
}
```

## Strings

"Here be dragons" - there can be 6 types of strings in Rust, but there are generally always two types:

1. A string slice `str` which we will generally get as a borrow string slice `&str`.
2. A `String` where the data can be modified.

You will often create a string by using the `to_string()` or `String::from()` methods on a string slice.

A borrowed string slice is essentially a pointer to a string slice and a length.

A `String` is a pointer to a string with a length and capacity.

Strings cannot be indexed by a number.

If you need to index things like graphemes, be sure to check out the packages out there.
