## Techniques and concepts

| Name                                                      | Explanation                                                                                                                                                                                      |

| Acknowledge, Align, Assure                                | A technique for disarming detractors                                                                                                                                                             |
| Constructive/Destructive feedback (positive and negative) | Know the difference to empower growth                                                                                                                                                            |
| The anchoring effect                                      | Occurs when a particular value for an unknown quantity influences your estimate of that quantity.                                                                                                |
| The science of availability                               | The ease with which we can think of examples is often used to judge the frequency of events.                                                                                                     |
| System 1                                                  | The fast, unconscious, automatic, error prone and everyday decision-making brain                                                                                                                 |
| System 2                                                  | The slow, conscious, effortful, complex decision making and reliable part of the brain                                                                                                           |
| Attention and Effort                                      | We avoid cognitive overload by breaking up current tasks into small steps to be committed to long term memory; we are naturally drawn to solutions that use as little mental effort as possible. |
| The lazy controller                                       | One of the main functions of System 2 is to monitor and control suggestions from System 1, however it is often lazy and places too much faith in intuition.                                      |
| Cognitive ease                                            | You act differently when experiencing cognitive ease vs. strain; you’ll probably make less errors when strained, but you won’t be as creative.                                                   |
| Underpromise and overdeliver                              | Always ensure that expectations set result in a pleasant surprise. Use circuit breakers here to deliver on promises.                                                                             |
| The 5 Whys                                                | Ask 5 questions to go deeper                                                                                                                                                                     |
| Raise Necessity                                           | When you are passionate about what you do, people understand. When you are obsessed, they think you're mad. That's the difference.                                                               |
| Opportunity = Importance + (Importance - Satisfaction)    | A minor improvement on an important task is almost always a larger opportunity than a big improvement on an ancillary one.                                                                       |
