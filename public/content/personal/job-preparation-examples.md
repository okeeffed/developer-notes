Many of these also comes from the page on [First Principles](https://docs.dennisokeeffe.com/manual-principles-software-first-principles)

a) Thinking fast and slow:

1. System 1 is the fast, unconcious system
2. System 2 to the present, aware, calculative system

b) CASMHDR for system design:

1. C: Clarify requirements
2. A: API Definition
3. S: Scale Estimatation
4. M: Modelling Data
5. H: High-Level Design
6. D: Detailed Design
7. R: Reduce Bottlenecks

c) ScREAM for understanding the requirements of a solid system:

1. Sc: Scalability
2. R: Reliability
3. A: Availability
4. E: Efficiency
5. M: Manageability

d) Coding First Principles

1. SOLID - Single Responsibility Principle, Open-Close Principle, Liskov's Substitution Princple, Interface Segregation Principle, Dependency Inversion Principle
2. KISS - Keep It Simple Stupid
3. DRY - Don't Repeat Yourself
4. YAGNI - You Ain't Gonna Need It
5. Composition > Inheritance
6. Separation of Concerns
7. Avoid Premature Optimisation
8. Refactor Refactor Refactor
9. Clean Code > Clever Code
10. Occam's Razor - Does the benefit outweigh the cost?
11. Least Astonishment Principle - Naming should come as no surprise to what it does
12. Law of Demeter - Divide responsibility between classes
