## Resources

1. [Entity Relationship Diagrams](https://drawio-app.com/entity-relationship-diagrams-with-draw-io/)

## Usage for Cloud

There are a few different ways to work with it all.

My personal preference would be to use familiar AWS service icons as describers.

There are also custom ones for a VPC, AWS Step Functions border, etc.

There are two different styles of ERDs.

### Style 1
