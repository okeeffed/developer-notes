<!-- TOC -->autoauto- [EXPRESS BASICS](#express-basics)auto    - [EXP-1: Getting Started with Express](#exp-1-getting-started-with-express)autoauto<!-- /TOC -->

## EXP-1: Getting Started with Express

1.  Installing express

For this example...

git clone https://github.com/hdngr/treehouse-express-basics.git

1.  Your first Express App

client: web browser
routes: urls for different pages

//in app.js

'use strict'; //throws error if you make one

var express = require('express'); //now can access all methods and properties of express through this.

var app = express();

//app variable will extended

//set up dev server

app.get('/', function(request, response) {
});

app.listen(3000);

3.  Improving your first app
    - some findal touches

Quick enhancements

```javascript
'use strict'; //throws error if you make one

var express = require('express'); //now can access all methods and properties of express through this.

var app = express();

//app variable will extended

//set up dev server

app.get('/', function(req, res) {
  //req and res are convention
  res.send('<h1>I Love Treehouse!<h1>');
});

app.listen(3000, function() {
  console.log('The frontend server is running on port 3000!');
});
```

PART 2: DEVELOPING EXPRESS APPS LIKE A BOSS

4.  Adding Routes to the App

Routes are an important part of Express.

We make can make some dummy json data for testing...

```json
{
  "I like to run!": {
    "title": "I like to run!",
    "description": "Fanny pack vinyl put a bird on it, small"
  },
  "Crossfit is cool!": {
    "title": "Crossfit is cool!",
    "description": "Fanny pack vinyl put a bird on it, small"
  },
  "Swimming is great for the joints": {
    "title": "Swimming is great for the joints",
    "description": "Fanny pack vinyl put a bird on it, small"
  }
}
```

```javascript
//app.js

'use strict'; //throws error if you make one

var express = require('express'); //now can access all methods and properties of express through this.
var post = require('./mock/posts.json');

var app = express();

//app variable will extended

//set up dev server

app.get('/', function(req, res) {
  //req and res are convention
  res.send('<h1>I Love Treehouse!<h1>');
});

app.get('/blog', function(req, res) {
  res.send(post);
});

app.listen(3000, function() {
  console.log('The frontend server is running on port 3000!');
});
```

QUESTIONS

/////////////////

Create a get method for a /blog html extension.

Use the send method on the response object to return the posts object when the /blog route is requested.

```javascript
'use strict';

var express = require('express');
var posts = require('./mock/posts.json');

var app = express();

app.get('/', function(req, res) {
  res.send('<h1>I Love Treehouse!</h1>');
});

app.get('/blog', function(req, res) {
  res.send(posts);
});

app.listen(3000, function() {
  console.log('The frontend server is running on port 3000!');
});
```

1.  Easily Debug Express

- Programming it iterative.

Nodemon not needing to stop and restart the server.

Node-inspector is great for debugging.

nodemon is like a replacement for the keyword node!

nodemon src/app //this will start a node.js app which restarts when changes are made.

5.  Interactive Debugging
    and explorative programming

node-debug src/app.js

- this launches node inspector in debug mode.

- select in the body of the route to set a breakpoint.
- access in the Chrome debugger

To put node-debugger and nodemon together.

Do this:
node-inspector //run this by itself. Won't run the server.

//in a seperate tab
nodemon --debug src/app

You can do the same thing with the regular node command - but with no server restart

node --debug src/app

Passing the breakpoint to the nodemon comment

nodemon --debug-brk src/app

- this will hit the debugger; statement.

QUESTIONS:

1.  When the debugger breaks in the application, you have access to all variables in the current application context in the browser’s console.

A: True

2.  What command will runs the node app in “debug” mode?

A: nodemon --debug src

3.  `node-inspector` can be used to run node apps directly OR to debug node apps being run in debug mode

A: True

4.  A breakpoint in a JavaScript application can be set by clicking on the line of a file in the browser console, or writing the **\_** statement directly into your code.

A: debugger;

5.  The following command will break the debugger on the first line

A: nodemon --debug-brk src/app

/////////////////

PART 3: THE REQUEST AND RESPONSE OBJECTS IN EXPRESS

    6.  Requests and the
        request objects

- Every route processes a request

So far, index AND blog route.

The server catches the http request, then sends back as a JS request object

In the debug mode:

req.param in debug currently empty. Can run the paramter through our routes!

eg.

```javascript
app.get('/blog/:id', function(req, res) {
  res.send(post);
});
```

Visiting .../blog/1 will set the id param to "1" etc

You can change the parameter names to be things like "title" or whatever you want.

QUESTIONS

////////////////////////

1.  The request object gives you access to the “hostname” where the server is serving from.

A: True

2.  Express route parameters allow you to request different data simply by changing the \_\_\_\_.

A: URL

3.  The request object is like a JavaScript bundle of the incoming **\_\_**

A: HTTP Request

4.  The request object stores route parameters in the parameters object.

A: False

    7.  Responses and the
        Response Object

The server sends back the response.

This includes HTML and tons of behind the scenes info.

- status codes, response info etc.

Using the debugger:

res //a lot going on

- this gives a lot of return details

Add a question mark makes the route param optional.

```javascript
app.get('/blog/:title?', function(req, res) {
  //now we can access the blog page when it is empty
  var title = req.params.title;
  if (title === undefined) {
    res.send('This page is under construction');
  } else {
    var post = posts[title];
    res.send(post);
  }
});
```

res.get

QUESTIONS

1.  In express the \_\_\_ character at the end of a route parameter indicates that it is optional.

A: ?

2.  Status codes can be set manually on the response object.

A: True

3.  The response object’s **\_** method is used to turn templates into HTML.

A: render

/////////////////

PART 4: USING TEMPLATES WITH EXPRESS

    7.  What is Template
        Rendering

Templates and template rendering at the core of an internet application framework.

res.send can send things to the browser.

Can also send back html.

Basically a example.html that can dynamically injected

This templates are referred to as VIEWS.

Popular template languages:

- Handlebars
- EJS (Embedded Javascript)
- JADE // the most popular


    8.  What is Jade?

Most popular template engines for Node and Express.

Why do they love it?

It quickly uses block indents for taggings.

Examples:

doctype html
html
head
title Express Basics
body
h1 This is an awesome HTML page, generated with Jade.
p.class1.class2.another-class //used to make classes
p.(class="test") Some content

9.  Using Jade in your
    Express App

How to configure your template to use Jade.

//app.js

'use strict'; //throws error if you make one

var express = require('express'); //now can access all methods and properties of express through this.
var posts = require('./mock/posts.json');

var app = express();

//app variable will extended

//set up dev server

app.set('view engine', 'jade');
app.set('views', **dirname + '/templates'); //**dirname important for different directories from where node starts

app.get('/', function(req, res) { //req and res are convention
res.render('index');
});

app.get('/blog/:title?', function(req, res) { //now we can access the blog page when it is empty
var title = req.params.title;
if (title === undefined) {
res.status(503); //good for bots to see this status codes
res.send("This page is under construction");
} else {
var post = posts[title];
res.send(post);
}
});

app.listen(3000, function(){
console.log("The frontend server is running on port 3000!");
});

QUESTIONS

1.  In node.js, `__dirname` is a variable that gives you:

A: The path to the current file

2.  Which of the following is NOT a conventional folder name for storing templates

A: jade

3.  In Jade's syntax, which of the following is NOT a correct assignment of the class `nav` to a `div`

4.  The response object's `render` method takes the name of a template as its first parameter. The file extension (e.g. `.jade`) is required.

A: False

10. The "response.render"
    Method

So far, still only been using static data.

doctype html
html(lang="en")
head
title Post Page
body
section.post
.container.text-right
a(href="").text-faded view all
.row
.col-lg-8.col-lg-offset-2.text-center
h2.section-heading I like to run!

            hr.light

            p.text-faded

//app.js

'use strict'; //throws error if you make one

var express = require('express'); //now can access all methods and properties of express through this.
var posts = require('./mock/posts.json');

var app = express();

//app variable will extended

//set up dev server

app.set('view engine', 'jade');
app.set('views', **dirname + '/templates'); //**dirname important for different directories from where node starts

app.get('/', function(req, res) { //req and res are convention
res.render('index');
});

app.get('/blog/:title?', function(req, res) { //now we can access the blog page when it is empty
var title = req.params.title;
if (title === undefined) {
res.status(503); //good for bots to see this status codes
res.send("This page is under construction");
} else {
var post = posts[title] || {};
res.render('post', { post: post});
}
});

app.listen(3000, function(){
console.log("The frontend server is running on port 3000!");
});

    11. Scaffolding the
        Templates

- Name your templates well
- Helps everyone for their team

in the layout.jade

block content //add more renderhtml from here

To add the content from layout.jade:

extends ./layout.jade
block content //again

    12. Adding Partials

Too much code in the layout file with the nav etc.

Solve by moving everything in a partial called nav.

- make partials directors

First file will be \_nav.jade

_ - not used on its own! Sass usually uses this _ naming convention before.

To use partial:
include ./partials/\_nav.jade

QUESTIONS:

1.  Keeping your project's views/templates folder well organized is an important part of scaling your project.

A: True

2.  Jade uses the **\_\_** keyword to break chunks of content up for use across different files, or to be changed dynamically.

A: 'block' e.g. 'block content'

3.  Partials are useful for including portions of a page like navbars and footers, that are the same, or almost the same across a number of pages.

A: True

/////////////////

PART 5: SERVING STATIC FILES IN EXPRESS

          	13. Setting Up the
    Express Static Server
    in Development

Static files: sent to client as is eg. images etc.

public dir:

- Contains other folders:
  css
  js
  img etc.

Middleware:

Middleware the logic on how to handle the a request in between when made by client but before it arrives at the route.

- included in Express.


    14. Add static to
        the layout template

Adding styles and js is easy.

In the head.jade template, punch through all of it.

link() in the head.jade

script() in the body.jade at the end

Notes:

Convention for static files is that they're stored in public.

/////////////////

PART 6: DOING MORE WITH EXPRESS

    15. Marking Lists
        in Jade Templates

In the blog...

res.render('index')

We need files to be in an array from the .json file.

- eg.

var postsLists = Object.keys(posts).map(function(value) {
return posts[value];
});

- map turns each array member into something that can have a callback function which can return the value.

16. Using logic in Jade

Powerful to just have one nav bar to edit and change.

So in Jade...

if path === '/'
//indent everything to be here

If something doesn't fit and is undefined, then it is false.

in app.js
//for the index

app.get('/', function(req, res) {
var path = req.path;
//res.locals.path = path;
//res.render('index');

    //OR

    res.render('index', {path: path});

});

QUESTIONS

1.  The `res.locals` object stores

A: Variables that will be accessible in the template

2.  In the case of the Jade if block `if path === '/'`, the block's content would NOT be displayed in which of the following scenarios

A: /blog

17. Use Express Generator

We don't have to build an Express app from scratch

npm install -g express-generator

express `<appname>`

npm start //this is a script

Instead of templates, it has views

    18. REST APIs

app.get('/posts', function(req,res) {
if (req.query.raw) {
res.json(posts);
} else {
res.json(postLists);
}
});

To allow to access as a hash:

- We can have /posts?raw=true
