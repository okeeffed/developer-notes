# Keystone Habit

Continuous interviewing is a keystone habit for continuous discovery.

## Deliberate Practice

Ericsson argues, when it comes to developing skill, doing the skill over and over again only helps to improve your skill until it becomes automatic.

After that, if you want to improve, you need to focus on deliberate practice.

Deliberate practice has the following key attributes:

- It involves breaking a skill into its component steps.
- It requires focusâ€”your full attention.
- It requires feedback.
- It requires getting outside your comfort zone.

> Your job is a marathon, your practice needs to be a sprint.
