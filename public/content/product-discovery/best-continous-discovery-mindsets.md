# Best Continuous Discovery Mindsets

Taken from https://www.producttalk.org/2018/10/continuous-discovery-mindsets/

The following mindsets act to favour the `outcomes over outputs` mentality.

## The Mindsets

- Collaborative mindset: working on a cross-functional team.
- Continuous mindset: the discovery is never done, the delivery is never done. Reduce the cycle times between customer touchpoints.
- Experimental mindset

## More On Continuous Mindset

1. Avoid "whether or not" decisions to prevent "confirmation bias".
2. Set up "compare and contrast" conversations. We want to ask which of these solutions best addresses the target opportunity.

## More On Experimental Mindset

A/B tests are great but expensive. We need to expand our repertoire of experiments to include prototyping, smoke screen tests, Wizard of Oz tests, concierge tests, and so on.

1. Do not assume success
2. Good tests kill flawed theories
3. Wisdom = knowing + doubt.

Dewey describes `The Double Movement of Reflection` as creating an inductive theory (theory of the whole) and using experiments to deductively test it.
