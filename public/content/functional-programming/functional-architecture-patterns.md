## Architecture

> You can't teach it in a meaningful way with meaningful architectures... as there is a tension between realistics examples that show the benefits vs something easy to understand.

Architecture is subjective, but tries to encompass or trade off to be:

1. Modular
2. Extendable
3. Performant
4. Maintainable
5. Readable

### The history of procedures

In the beginning, there we procedures that we began to group and work on. There is a reference to `Domain-Driven Design`, which is reference as the path we start going down.

Having procedures groups that don't scale well make people wonder why we do abstracting the first place.

## Properties of FP

```javascript
// associative
add(add(1, 1), 4) === add(1, add(1, 4));
// communitive
add(1, 4) === add(4, 1);
// identity
add(n, 0) === n;
// distributive
multiply(2, add(3, 4)) === add(multiply(2, 3), multiply(2, 4));
```

```javascript
const joinWithSpace = joinable => joinable.join(' ');
```
