## Template include tags

Template include tags are used within one template file (for example index.php) to include (or call) the HTML and PHP found in another template file (for example header.php). While PHP has its own built-in include() statement to do this, these WordPress-specific tags make life much easier:

```php
<?php get_header(); ?> – Includes the header.php file
<?php get_sidebar(); ?> – Includes the sidebar.php file
<?php get_footer(); ?> – Includes the footer.php file
<?php comments_template(); ?> – Includes your comments

//
//
// WORDPRESS HEADER/BLOG INFO TAGS
//
//

These are functions you’ll find in your theme’s header.php file, though you’ll also find them in other theme files:

<?php bloginfo('name'); ?> – The title of your site, or blog name
<?php bloginfo('url'); ?> – Your site’s URL
<?php bloginfo('stylesheet_url'); ?> – Link to your themes’s stylesheet file
<?php bloginfo('template_url'); ?> – Location of your site’s theme file
<?php bloginfo('description'); ?> – Displays the tagline of your blog as set in Settings > General.
<?php bloginfo('atom_url'); ?> – Link to your site’s atom URL
<?php bloginfo('rss2_url'); ?> – RSS feed URL for your site
<?php bloginfo('pingback_url'); ?> – Pingback URL for your site
<?php bloginfo('version'); ?> – WordPress version number
<?php bloginfo('html_type'); ?> – The HTML version your site is using
<?php site_url(); ?> – The root URL for your site
<?php get_stylesheet_directory(); ?> – Location of your stylesheet folder
<?php wp_title(); ?> – Title of a specific page
```

## Other template tags

These tags can be used across all of your template files, such as index.php or page.php, making it easy to display specific information anywhere you want on your site:

```php
<?php the_content(); ?> – Displays the content of a post
<?php the_excerpt(); ?> – Displays the excerpt used in posts
<?php the_title(); ?> – Title of the specific post
<?php the_permalink() ?> – Link of a specific post
<?php the_category(', ') ?> – Category of a specific post
<?php the_author(); ?> – Author of a specific post
<?php the_ID(); ?> – ID of a specific post
<?php edit_post_link(); ?> – Edit link for a post
<?php next_post_link(' %link ') ?> – URL of the next page
<?php previous_post_link('%link') ?> – URL of the previous page
<?php get_links_list(); ?> – Lists all links in blogroll
<?php wp_list_pages(); ?> – Lists all pages
<?php wp_get_archives() ?> – List archive for the site
<?php wp_list_cats(); ?> – Lists all categories
<?php get_calendar(); ?> – Displays the built-in calendar
<?php wp_register(); ?> – Displays register link
<?php wp_loginout(); ?> – Displays login/logout link only to registered users
```

## Other loops

The Loop is the default mechanism in WordPress for displaying all of your posts. Exactly how many posts are retrieved is determined by the number of posts you’ve chosen to display in the “Reading” settings in your WordPress dashboard.

Within the Loop, WordPress loops through each post retrieved for the current page one at a time and formats it according to your theme’s instructions.

You can use the Loop to do a lot of useful stuff, like:

Display post titles and excerpts on your homepage;
Display the content and comments on a single post;
Display the content on an individual page using template tags; and
Display data from custom post types and custom fields.

```php
<?php
    if ( have_posts() ) :
        while ( have_posts() ) :
            the_post();
            //
            // Post Content here
            //
        endwhile; // end while
    endif; // end if
?>
```

The Loop can display lots of different element for each post. Some of the most common template tags used in themes (according to the WordPress Theme Handbook) are:

next_post_link() – A link to the post published chronologically after the current post
previous_post_link() – A link to the post published chronologically before the current post
the_category() – The category or categories associated with the post or page being viewed
the_author() – The author of the post or page
the_content() – The main content for a post or page
the_excerpt() – The first 55 words of a post’s main content followed by an ellipsis (…) or read more link that goes to the full post. You may also use the “Excerpt” field of a post to customize the length of a particular excerpt.
the_ID() – The ID for the post or page
the_meta() – The custom fields associated with the post or page
the_shortlink() – A link to the page or post using the URL of the site and the ID of the post or page
the_tags() – The tag or tags associated with the post
the_title() – The title of the post or page
the_time() – The time or date for the post or page. This can be customized using standard php date function formatting.

You can also use conditional tags, such as:

is_home() – Returns true if the current page is the homepage
is_admin() – Returns true if an administrator is logged in and visiting the site
is_single() – Returns true if the page is currently displaying a single post
is_page() – Returns true if the page is currently displaying a single page
is_page_template() – Can be used to determine if a page is using a specific template, for example: is_page_template('about-page.php')
is_category() – Returns true if page or post has the specified category, for example is_category('news')
is_tag() – Returns true if a page or post has the specified tag
is_author() – Returns true if a specific author is logged in and visiting the site
is_search() – Returns true if the current page is a search results page
is_404() – Returns true if the current page does not exist
has_excerpt() – Returns true if the post or page has an excerpt
