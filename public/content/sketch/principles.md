# Principles

## Organising symbols

Use the symbol organiser to auto-organise symbols.

## Naming conventions

When it comes to naming principles, use the convention of `Button/Primary/Light` with aims that the first word can be parsed by sketch up for type and the following elements of a `/` split array can be use to denote classnames.

Anything split by `/` itself becomes a classname when converted using sketchup.

When naming pages and components, just use camel casing with no splits.

## Creating new symbols

For the sake of creating base components, just use the basic colours and treat it like a wireframe. These components can then take on the naming convention above.

When designing a new set of components, then detach the symbol in the page workflow. From here, you make create it as a new symbol as required.
