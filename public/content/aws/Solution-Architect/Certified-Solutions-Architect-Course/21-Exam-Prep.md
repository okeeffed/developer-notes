# 21: Exam Preparation

## Main Exam Prep

### Last-Minute Review

- Great idea to through exam tips the day before the exam. Focus on areas least comfortable with.
- Practice exam. Run through them a lot.
- Take a break. Don't think about AWS for a bit.

### What happens when you are stuck?

- Search for the answer yourself.
- Try to build it in an actual AWS account.
- Check AWS FAQs.
- Post in the ACG Forum.

### Taking Notes

- Sometimes a drawing form is a great way to take notes.
- AWS Architecture Center is a great resource. Think of it like best practice.
- There are reference architecture diagrams on the website.

## Tackling Exam Questions

### Question Strategy

1. Spot the distractors.
2. Watch out for modifiers "most", "least", etc.
3. The word soup is never right! If it makes you laugh, it's wrong.
4. Word association is your friend.
5. Read every answer at least once.
