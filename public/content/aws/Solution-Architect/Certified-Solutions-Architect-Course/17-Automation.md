# 17: Automation

## Why Use Automation

- Manual build are a gamble. You are more likely to make some costly errors.
- Computers don't make mistakes.

### Benefits

- Time: You have more important things to do.
- Security: Manually you will create a security hole.
- Consistency: You get the same results, every time.

### Upcoming Services to learn about

1. CloudFormation: Provision resources quickly and consistently and manage them throughout their lifecycles by treating infrastructure as code.
2. Elastic Beanstalk: Easy-to-use all in one service for deploying and scaling web applications and services developed with a variety of supported languages.
3. Systems Manager: Gives you the ability to easily patch, update, maange and configure your EC2 instances along with on-premise architecture.

Exam tip:

1. Replace manual steps with automated tools.
2. Automate yourself out of your job.
3. You'll need to know the right tool for the right job.
4. Benefits to automatio: it's more reliable and faster.
5. Immutable: allows you to easily create and destroy your architecture as needed.

## CloudFormation

- Step 1 Write code: Declarative JSON or YAML.
- Step 2 Deploy template: CF will go through the process of making the needed AWS API calls on your behalf.

Exam tips:

- CF is great for immutable architecture. You can easily pick that template up and run it anywhere you want.
- Know the basics of a CL tempalte and what the sections do.
- Cross-Region: Hard-coded values and resource IDs can be the reason templates fail to create.
- Troubleshooting: CF rolls back to last known good state (or deletes if first time).
- It's just an API call.
- Immutable: Can easily create and destroy your entire architecture.

## Elastic Beanstalk

Platform-as-a-Service. A single-stop app deployment model.

You bring your code and the provider builds everything for you, deploys your app and manages going forward.

EB is that PaaS tool for AWS.

- Automation: EB automates all of your deployments. You can template what your environment looks like.
- Deployment: It handles deployments for you.
- Management: Keeps instances online and healthy.

In the dashboard, you can click and deploy a sample application.

You can edit extra settings around things that we have seen previously from other services.

Exam tips:

- EB is easy.
- Not heavily featured on the exam.
- Platform types: contains, Windows and Linux applications.
- Hand holding: a great solution to start with, but in general it's only for simpler web applications.
- Traditional: not serverless.

## Systems Manager

A suite of tools designed to let you view, control and automate both your AWS architecture and on-prem resources.

## Features of Systems Manager

- Automation documents: control your instances of AWS resources. Technically now called runbooks.
- Run command: execute commands on your hosts.
- Patch manager: Managers your app versions.
- Parameter Store: Securely store your secret values.
- Hybrid Activations: Control your on-premises architecture using Systems Manager.
- Session Manager: Remotely connect and interact with your architecture.

There is more, but won't be covered in the associate exam.

Prerequisites to use it:

1. An EC2 instance created.
2. A systems manager agent installed on that instance.

A role is required for the EC2 in order to talk to the Systems Manager agent.

Exam tips:

- Systems Manager will rarely be called out by name. Instead, the name of the features will be used. Example: Automation documents (runbooks) to fix S3 bucket permissions or using Session Manager to connect to an instance.
- You don't need to deep dive.
- On-site support: both on prem and cloud architecture.
- Unpaid SysAdmin: If an admin can do it, Systems Manager can as well.
- Automation Documents: Usable by AWS Config to enforce architecture state.
