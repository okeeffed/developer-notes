# S3

## Overview

You need to know this service inside and out to pass the exam.

What is S3? It is a storage service that provides a way to store data in the cloud.

- Secure, durable, highly scalable storage.
- Allows you to store and retrieve any amount of data from anywhere on the web at a very low cost.
- Simple. Straight-forward web interface.

### Object-based storage

- Manages data as objects rather than in file systems or data blocks.
- Upload any file type to S3.
- Cannot be used to run an OS or database.
- Unlimited storage.
- Objects up to 5TB in size.
- Stored in S3 buckets (similar to folders).

Buckets are a universal namespace. All AWS accounts share the namespace. It must be globally unique.

The S3 URL looks like `https://<bucket-name>.s3.<region>.amazonaws.com/<key-name>`.

When you upload a file, a successful upload will get a 200 response.

### Key-Value Store

- Key: name of the object.
- Value: data itself as a sequence of bytes.
- Version ID: Import for storing multiple versions of the same object.
- Metadata: Data about the data you are storing (`content-type`, `last-modified`, etc.)

### Highly Available and Highly Durable

- Built for 99.95% - 99.99% service availability, depending on S3 tier.
- Design for 99.999999999% (nice 9's) service durability (ie will my data be lost?).

### Standard S3

- High availability and durability. Sotred in > 3 AZs.
- Design for frequently accessed data.
- Suitable for most workloads.
- Default storage class.
- Use cases: websites, content distribution, mobile and gaming apps, big data analytics.

### Characteristics

- Tiered Storage: S3 offers a range of storage classes for different use cases.
- Lifecycle management: rules to transition objects to a cheaper storage tier or delete objects that are no longer required after a set period of time.
- Versioning: all versions of objects are stored and can be retrieved (including deleted objects).

### Securing Your Data

- Server-Side Encryption: you can set default encryption to a bucket to encrypt all new objects when stored. Great for if someone breaks into the data center and steals the hard drive.
- Access Control Lists (ACLs): define which accounts or groups are granted access and the type of access. You can attach S3 ACLs to invidual objects within a bucket.
- Bucket policies: specific to actions allowed and denied to the bucket (ie. allow user Alice to PUT but not DELETE objects in the bucket).

### Data consistency

Strong Read-After-Write Consistency.

- After a successful write of a new object (or overwrite), any subsequent read request immediately receives the latest version of the object.
- Strong consistency for list operations, so after a write, you can immediately perform a listing of the objects in a bucket with all changes reflected.

### What to know

- Object Based
- Files up to 5TB
- Unlimited storage
- Not OS or DB storage

Files are stored in buckets and S3 is a universal namespace. Know the URL build out and 200 response on success.

Four more tips:

- Key: Name of object.
- Value: The data itself (which is made up of a sequence of bytes).
- Version ID: Allows you to store multiple versions of the same object.
- Metadata: Data about the data you are storing (e.g. `content-type`)

## Securing Your Bucket with S3 Block Public Access

- Object ACLs: work on an individual object level.
- Bucket Policy: work on the entire bucket.

By default, all public access is blocked.

If a bucket is not public, you cannot override the access level of an individual object.

Review on tips:

- Buckets are private by default.
- Objects ACLs can make individual objects public (require bucket to be public).
- Bucket policies can make the entire bucket public.
- HTTP status code: 200 success.

## Hosting a Static Website Using S3

Can host static websites (such as `.html` websites). Cannot do Dynamic websites.

- Scales automatically to meet demand.

The policy required for hosting a static website:

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "PublicReadGetObject",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": "*",
      "Action": ["s3:GetObject"],
      "Resource": ["arn:aws:s3::BUCKET_NAME/*"]
    }
  ]
}
```

The resources given are a basic `index.html` page and an `error.html` page.

When creating a new bucket via the console, you specify that you want to host a static website and you set the object entry point and error page.

You could make the files individually public, but that is time consuming. Instead, we edit the bucket policy to allow access.

To recap:

- Bucket policies: make sure entire buckets are public using policies.
- Static content: use s3 to host static content only (not dynamic).
- Automatic scaling: S3 scales automatically with demand.

## Versioning Objects in S3

You can enable versioning in S3 to allow multiple versions of objects within a bucket.

- All versions: all versions stored.
- Can be a great backup tool.
- Cannot be disabled (can suspend).
- Lifecycle rules.
- Supports MFA.

Inside of a bucket, you go to `Properties` and you can edit to enable bucket versioning.

Once on, there will be a toggle to `List Versions` that can show which version of the object is there. The demo itself uploads to new file.

Previous versions do not allow access (even if the policy is for a public policy). You can turn the ACL for that object to be public.

For deleted objects, the versions will still be there (but with a `delete marker`). Once you delete the `delete marker`, it actually reverts to the previous version.

## S3 Storage Classes

For standard:

- High availability and durability. 4 9's availability, 11 9's durability.
- Designed for Frequent Access.
- Suitable for Most Workloads.

For Standard-IA (infrequent access):

- Rapid access.
- You pay to access data (low per-GB storage price) and a per-GB retrieval fee.
- Use cases: great for long-term storage, backups and as a data store for disaster recovery.
- 3 9's availability, 9 9's durability.

For S3 One Zone Infrequent Access (1ZIA):

- Like Standard-IA, but data store redundantly within a single AZ.
- Costs 20% less than regular S3 Standard-IA.
- 99.% percent availability.

### Glacier

- Cheap storage.
- Optimized for very infrequently accessed data.
- Pay for each time you access.
- Use only for archiving data.

Glacier (cold storage) is the last type and has two options.

- Option 1: Provides long-term data archiving with retrieval times that range from 1 minute to 12 hours (eg historical data only access a few times per year).
- Option 2: Deep archive. Archiving data rarely access. Access time is 12 hours. Only use if accessed once or twice a year (think financial records).

- Glaciers has 4 9's availbility and 11 9's durability.

### S3 Intelligent-Tiering

- Frequent + infrequent access. It automatically moves your data to the most cost-effective tier based on how frequently you access each object.
- $0.0025 per 1000 objects per month.
- 3 9's availability, 11 9's durability.

Be sure to know the different use-cases in S3 storage tiers.

## Lifecycle Management with S3

Automates the moving of objects between different storage tiers.

E.g. you may set S3 Standard object unused for 30 days to S3 IA and 90 days to Glacier.

You can integrate this with versioning too!

In the bucket under `Management`, you can create your Lifecycle rule.

- You can add to all objects.
- You can add to individual objects.

With versioning turned on, you can also change the rule actions for things such as "transition".

With each action, you can specify which object is transitioned after X amount of days to what class.

Once created, you can also see a `Timeline` summary.

The tips:

- Automates moving of objects between different storage tiers.
- Can be used in conjunction with versioning.
- Can be applied to current versions and previous versions.

## S3 Object Lock And Glacier Vault Lock

You can use S3 Object Lock to store objects using a `write once, read many` (WORM) model. It can help prevent objecst from being deleted or modified for a fixed amount of time or indefinitely.

You can use it to meet regulatory requirements that require WORM storage, or to add an extra layer of protection again object changes and deletion.

### Governance mode

Users can't overwrite or delete an object version or alter its lock settings unless they have special permissions.

### Compliance mode

No one can overwrite or delete an object version or alter its lock settings.

### Retention Periods

Protects an object version for a fixed amount of time.

After the period expires, the object version can be overwritten or deleted unless you also placed a legal hold on the object version.

### Legal Holds

S3 Object Lock enables you to place a legal hold on an object version. Like a retention period, it prevents overwrite/deltion, however it doesn't have an associated retention period and remains in effect until removed.

Those with the `s3:PutObjectLegalHold` permission can add/remove.

### Glacier Vault Lock

Allows you to easily deploy and enforce compliance controls for individual Glacier Vaults with a Vault lock policy.

You can specify controls (such as WORM) in a Vault lock policy and lock policy from future edits. Once locked, the policy can no longer be changed.

### S3 Object Lock Exam Tips

- Use `S3 Object Lock` to store objects using a write once, read many (WORM) model.
- Object locks can be applied to individual objects or applied across the bucket.
- Object locks come in two modes: governance and compliance.

## Encypting S3 Objects

The types of encryption:

1. Encryption in transit: SSL/TLS, HTTPS.
2. Encryption at rest (server): SSE-C (Customer provided keys), SSE-KMS, SSE-S3 (S3-managed keys, using AES 256-bit encryption).
3. Encryption at rest (client): Encypting files before uploading them to S3.

You can enforce server-side encryption:

1. Through the console. This is the easiest way.
2. Through a bucket policy.

If the file is to be encrypted at upload time, the `x-amz-server-side-encryption` parameter will need to be included in the request header.

There are two options: `AES256` or `aws:kms`.

It is put into the header to tell S3 to encrypt objects during the upload.

To enforce this, you can set a bucket policy to deny any object PUT request that does not include the encryption header.

In the console, there is a `Default Encryption` option when creating a bucket.

## Optimizing S3 Performance

The S3 prefix for `mybucketname/folder1/subfolder1/myfile.jpg` is `folder1/subfolder1`.

- S3 has low latecy (100-200ms for first byte).
- You can achieve high number of requests: 3500 PUT/COPY/POST/DELETE and 5,500 GET/HEAD requests per second per prefix.
- You can get better performance by spreadin reads across different prefixes.
- If we used 4 prefixes as an exampe, we would achieve 22k requests per second.

The limitations with KMS:

- If you use `SSE-KMS`, to encrypt the objects in S3 you must be mindful of KMS limits.
- When you `upload` a file, you will call `GenerateDataKey` in the KMS API.
- When you `download` a file, you will call `Decrypt`.
- The KMS req rate changes per region, however it is either 5.5k, 10k or 30k per second.
- Currently you cannot request a quota increase for KMS.

### Multipart Uploads

- Recommended for files over 100MB.
- Required for files over 5GB.
- Parellelize uploads (increases efficiency).

### S3 Byte-Range Fetches

- Parallelize downloads by specifying byte range.
- If there's a failure in the download, it's only for a specific byte range.

## Back up Data With S3 Replication

Used to be called cross-region replication, but now can happen in the same region.

- A way of replicating objects from one bucket to another. Versioning must be enabled on both the source and destination buckets.
- Objects in an existing bucket are not replicated automatically. Once turned on, all subsequent updated objects will be replicated automatically.
- Delete markers are not replicated by default. You can turn this on.

To demo: you can create replication rules under `Management`. You will need versioning on first. You can select the destination bucket from there.

The tips:

- You can replicate objects from one bucket to another.
- Existing not replicated automatically.
- Delete markers are not replicated by default. You can turn this on.
