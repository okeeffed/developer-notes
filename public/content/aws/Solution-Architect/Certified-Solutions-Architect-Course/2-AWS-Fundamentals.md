# AWS Fundamentals

## The Building Blocks of AWS

- Region vs availability zones: availability zone can be thought of as a data center (it may be multiple but grouped into one).
- A region is a geographical area that consists of availability zones.
- Edge locations: endpoints for AWS used for caching content. Typically consists of CloudFront.

## Who Owns What In The Cloud?

> Analogy initially used that speaks about the responsibility for whom when renting a car.

The "Shared Responsibility Model" is a model that is used by AWS to determine who owns what in the cloud.

Customer:

- Custom data
- Platform, Applications, IAM
- Operating System Network & Firewall Configuration
- Client-Side Data Encryption & Data Integrity Authentication
- Server-Side Encryption (FS and/or data)
- Networking traffic protection (encryption, integrity, identity)

AWS:

- Software: Compute, Storage, Database, Networking
- Hardware/AWS Global Infra: Regions, AZs, Edge Locations

Question: can you do this yourself in the AWS Management Console? If yes, you are likely responsible. Otherwise, AWS is likely responsible (ie. their data centers, etc.).

**Encryption is a shared responsibility.**

## Compute, Storage, Databases

- Compute (things to crunch the data): EC2, Lambda, Elastic Beanstalk.
- Storage (safe place to save data): S3, EBS (Elastic Block Store), EFS (Elastic File Service), FSx, Storage Gateway.
- Database (reliable way to store and retrieve info): RDS, DynamoDB, Redshift (database warehousing tech).
- Networking (how the others communicate with each other): VPCs, Direct Connect, Route 53, API Gateway, AWS Global Accelerator.

## What is the Well-Architected Framework

AWS has hundreds of whitepapers available.

Each piller of the Well-Architected Framework has its own whitepaper.

- Operational Excellence
- Security
- Reliability
- Performance Efficiency
- Cost Optimization

Read the white paper before the exam.

## Exam Tips

### AWS Building Blocks Tips

1. Region is a physical locations that consists of two or more AZs.
2. AZ is one or more discrete data centers - each with redundant power, networking and connectivity - housed in separate facilities.
3. Edge locations are endpoints for AWS that are used for caching content. Typically consists of CloudFront.
