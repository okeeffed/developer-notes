# AWS Fargate With ECS

This is a quick walkthrough that was done using Linux Academy.

## Steps to complete

1. Log into the console
2. Head to ECS
3. Head the `Task Definitions`
4. Select `Fargate` and go next
5. We don't need a `Task Role` since there are no AWS network tasks
6. Since we are just creating an NGINX container, set the allocation for CPU and memory to the lowest
7. Add a container and set it to be `nginx:latest`
8. Memory limit 300mb
9. Set `Port mappings` to 80 for Nginx
10. Click add, scroll to the bottom and head to the next page
11. After creating, we can now run our task (from the drop down)
12. Launch type, select `Fargate`
13. Select the VPC, Subnets etc
14. Auto-enable Fargate IP
15. Run the task
16. Once task it running, click the task and copy the IP

Bingo! Success in creating a task using Fargate.
