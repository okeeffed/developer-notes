## Mnemonic

The mnemonic used is **FIGHT DR MCPXZ AU**. The letters stand for:

| Letter | Instance                         |
| ------ | -------------------------------- |
| F      | FPGA                             |
| I      | IOPS                             |
| G      | Graphics                         |
| H      | High disk throughput             |
| T      | cheap general purpose            |
| D      | Density                          |
| R      | RAM                              |
| M      | Main choice general purpose apps |
| C      | Compute                          |
| P      | Picture (graphics)               |
| X      | eXtreme memory                   |
| Z      | Z-factor. Extreme memory and CPU |
| A      | ARM based instances              |
| U      | Bare metal                       |

Taking it further with the PEG Method (these should be your own creation):
