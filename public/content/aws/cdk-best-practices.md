# CDK Best Practices

These come from the Open CDK repo. Most copied here are probably worthwhile knowning.

The CDK constants repo is also a great way to find constants for things like `ServicePrinciples` and `ManagedPolicies`.

## Resources

1. [Open CDK]
2. [CDK Examples](https://github.com/aws-samples/aws-cdk-examples)

## Structure

- split the bin directory so you have one command per app
- split the lib by application
- create a functions directory if you plan on importing lambda functions via code assets

```s
- bin/
    - create-serviceA.ts
    - create-serviceB.ts
- lib
    - serviceA/
    - serviceB/
    - common/
- functions/
    - func1/
    - func2
```
