## The New Rules - How to Become the Smartest Person... in Any Room

-   Framing effect: people place greater value on going from 90% to 100% than 45% to 55%.
-   Prospect Theory: a theory behind why we take unwarranted risks in the face of uncertain losses. The most famous being Loss Aversion, which shows people are more likely to act to avert a loss than to achieve an equal gain.
-   The psychological tactics required were to calm people down, establish rapport, gain trust, elicit the verbalization of needs and persuade the other guy of our empathy.
-   Listening is the cheapest and most effective concession to get to earning trust. It is not a passive activity, but in fact the most active thing you can do.

## Be a Mirror - How to Quickly Establish Rapport

-   Good negotiators know there will be surprises; great negotiotars aim to use their skills to reveal these surprises.
-   Under you know what you are dealing with, you do not know what you are dealing with.
-   George A. Miller put forth that we can only process about seven pieces of information at a time. We are easily overwhelmed.
-   "A state of schizophrenia": the voice inside of one's head that you listen to can impede conversation. When two are in conversation, really there could be four.
-   The goal is to identif what your counterparts need and get them feeling safe enough to talk and talk and talk more about what they want.
-   Talk slowly and convey one idea: I am in control.
-   Mirroring, also called isopraxism, is essentially imitation.
-   Don't commit to assumptions. View them as hypotheses and use negotiation to test them rigorously.

### Three tones available to negotiators

## Don't Feel Their Pain, Label It - How to Create Trust with Tactical Empathy

-   "Seperate people from the problem." Don't get emotional.
-   "The supreme art of war": to subdue an enemy without fighting (Sun Tzu).
-   The best way to deal with negativity is the observe it, without reaction and without judgement. Then consciously label each negative feeling and replace it with positive, compassionate and solution-based thoughts.

## Beware Yes, Master No - How to Generate Momentum and Make It Safe to Reveal the Real Stakes

-   Compromise and conession, even to the truth, feels like defeat.
-   "Yes" is a meaningless answer that hides deeper objections ("maybe" is even worse).
-   Teach yourself to respond to "no" as something other than rejection, and respond accordingly.
-   Use the power of a "no" answer to provoke a response.
-   By turning niceness into a lubricant, we've leeched it of meaning.
