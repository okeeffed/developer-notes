# Mastering Logical Fallacies - Michael Withey

## Ad Hominems

1.  Abusive - claim someone to be a bigot/racist etc to discredit their argument
2.  Circumstantial - claim a circumstance to discredit their argument ie discrediting someone because "they are just saying that to get permission"
3.  Guilt by association - discredit an argument due to affiliation
4.  Tu quoque - discrediting an argument becaues the proponent engages in such an act. Ie someone might be a hypocrite for smoking and saying it is bad, but their argument is still valid.
