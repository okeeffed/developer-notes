## Mindsets

-   The discovery that a man can do what he is afraid to do (paraphrasing Henry Ford).
-   Nervous excitement over nervous fear.

### Purpose of talking about yourself

-   Excite and intrigue. Then turn the conversation back onto them.
-   No to good job, money, looks. Yes to dominance, sociability, altruism.
    -   Dominance: know the abundance, go for what you want:
        1.  Achieved something you thought impossible
        2.  Took charge of a situation without knowing the outcome
        3.  A time you successfully led a group
        -   "I love art, but everyone told you can never succeed in that profession. That only motivated me more to prove people wrong. Within a few months..."
    -   Sociability: The ability to bring them around friends and not creep them out. You're a cool, confident guy who can talk to anyone.
        1.  Time you hung out with friends and had fun
        2.  Time you connected to someone you looked up to
        3.  Time you introduced two groups of friends to each other
    -   Altruistic: concerns about other people and their rights, feelings and welfare.

## How to talk about yourself

1.  Reciprocity
2.  The open loop
3.  Don't make conversation about yourself
4.  Know your "hero story"
5.  Poke fun at your mistakes and the lessons learned

### Telling stories

-   It should help you connect with others

-   End with a bang
