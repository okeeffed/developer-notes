## Personal Habits

1.  Seek Clarity
2.  Generate Energy
3.  Raise Necessity

### Seek Clarity

- "If you leave your growth the randomness, you'll always live in the land of mediocrity."
- No goals, no growth. No clarity, no change.
- "Unhappiness is not knowing what we want and killing ourseles to get it." - Don Herold
- Is work just a job, an important career or a calling.
- Enthusiasm + Connection + Satisfaction + Coherence = Meaning

### Generate Energy

- There's perhaps no better way to increase ongoing happiness than to start a gratitude practice.

### Raise Necessity

- Four forces of necessity: identity, obsession, duty and urgency.
- When you are passionate about what you do, people understand. When you are obsessed, they think you're mad. That's the difference.
- This is the way high performers speak about their goals and their whys. They don't sound doubtful. They have confidence in the reasons they are working so hard and they are proud to tell you about their purpose.

## Social Habits

4.  Increase Productivity
5.  Develop Influence
6.  Demonstrate Courage

### Increase Productivity

- The fundamentals: setting goals and maintaining energy and focus. No goals, no focus, no energy - you are dead in the water.
- Organise life into ten distinct categories: health, family, friends, intimate relationship, mission/work, finances, adventure, hobby, spirituality and emotion.

### Demonstrate Courage

- "Only those who risk going too far can possibly find out how far one will go." - T.S. Eliot.

## Sustaining Success

7.  Beware Three Traps
8.  The #1 Thing
9.  Summary Guide

### Beware Three Traps

- Keep telling yourself other people won't understand and it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy.
- The exhausting, negative, emotional prison that is constant dissatisfaction saps performance. Perennial dissatisfaction is the first step on the path to misery.

### The Number One Thing

- Nothing correlates like confidence.
- You can not be congruent with something you've never defined. no clarity, no congruence, no confidence. It is that simple.
