# Strategize

## Rough Notes

### Core, Adjacent and Disruptive Innovations:

- Core: Optimizing existing products for established markets. Draws on skills and assets the company already has in place and makes incremental changes to current products.
- Adjacent: Leveraging something your company does well into a new space.
- Disruptive: Solves a customer problem in a better, more convenient, cheaper way than alternatives.
- Idea validation for Core to Disruptive is `low` to `high`.

### Customer Segments

- Customer-first attribute segments: when making core innovations.
- Benefit-first segments: when making adjacent or disruptive innovations.
- Avoid these two mistakes:
  1. Don't blindly follow predefined segments.
  2. Don't discard an idea because it does not fit into predefined segments.
- A good way to measure Market Segments is to use the `GE/McKinsey Matrix`. This is a XY scatter plot that pits `Business Strength` on the X axis vs `Segment Attractiveness` on the Y axis (both from low to high).
  - Determining Attractivesness:
    - Need
    - Segment size
    - Growth rate
    - Competitors
    - Entry barriers

### Personas

- Don't clutter personas with irrelevant characteristics, attitudes and behaviours.

### Find an itch that worth scratching 

- Understand why people would want to buy and use it.
- The product must be `sticky`.
- Vitamins: Products like Sonos that don't solve a pain or urgeny need. A nice-to-have.
- Painkillers: Products that address a problem like Bing or Google Search.

### Strategy Canvas

- Captures key factors the industry competes on ie product, service, delivery.
- Looks like two comparative line graphs with enlarged nodes.

### Kano Model

- Implemented vs satisfied axes.
- Comprised of `Delighters`, `Performers` and `Basics`.
- Think iPhone, basics were call and text, performers were mobile Internet and a media player, delighters were touch screen and stylish new design.
- When comparing `Strategy Canvas` vs `Kano Model`, the delighters are like new features and performers resemble the raised factors.
  - Kano lacks explicit reference to competitors, but recognises some features can be detractors.

### Eliminate-Raise-Reduce-Create grid

- This grid helps determine which features to keep/cut. This can be overlaid with the `strategy canvas`.

### Build Variants and Unbundle Your Product

- Unbundling features and introducing product variants can enable you to effectively grow the product, serve a new segment, generate more business benefits, and increase the product's competitiveness.
- When spinning off features or developments, consider creating standards and assets â€” including components, services and other archtiectural building blocks.
- You can also `bundle` your product when individual products are too small and not attractive enough to succeed on their own. Example: combining Internet Explorer and Windows helped Microsoft win the first "browser war".

### Reposition Your Product

- Subbranding is important: there are different associations with Apple, Google, Amazon when compared to the iPhone, Google Maps, Amazon Web Services.

### Uncategorised notes

- Use data to make decisions.
- Turn failure into opportunity.
- Get out of the building.
- Focus on the biggest risk, not necessarily the technical feasibility.
- Red-dot game: give everyone three dots and ask them to place it beside what they are most concerned about.
- Problem interviews: structured conversations with target users and customers.
- Pivoting is only attractive if you pivot early, when the cost of changing direction is comparatively low.
- Timebox: fixed period of time that cannot be extended.

## Product Roadmap

- Roadsmaps translate strategic decisions into actionable plans that provide direction for the dev team and the other stakeholders.

### Roadmap Foundations

- In the simplesrt form, the roadmap indicates how a product is likely to evolve with major releases.
- Can be feature-based or goal-orientated.
- Best roadmapping approach for product depends on amout of uncertainty and change present.
  - Matrix to help has X axis Market vs Y Axis Product.
  - Product grouped as young/mature.
  - Market grouped as dynamic/stable.
  - Feature-based roadmaps only useful for mature/stable, else goal-orientated.
- Get a relationship between the backlog and product roadmap right.

### Road-Mapping Pitfalls

- No guarantee: roadmaps are a high-level plan.
- No speculation: Don't create a roadmap if you don't have a valid product strategy available.
- No epics or user stories. (FYI Epics are longer narratives that contain multiple stories.)
- Make roadmap SMART (specific, measureable, agreed, realistic, time-bound).

### GO Product Roadmap

- Spreadsheet consisting of:
  - Dates/time frames
  - Release names
  - Reason for new release
  - High-level features necessary to meet the goals
  - Metrics to determine if the goals have been met
