## Vim Packages and creating files

Installing Vim `yum install vim` of `apt-get install vim`.

`vim -g` can actually run the GUI - who cares though. There are a number of different GUI wrappers. `gvim` is the most popular.

So we have `vi`, `vim` - the improved vi and `gvim`.

## Vim modes, navigation and commands

1.  Command/Normal mode
2.  Insert/Ex mode
3.  Mark mode
