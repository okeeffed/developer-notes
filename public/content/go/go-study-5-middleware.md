# Go Study Middleware

Notes from the fifth session.

## Rough Notes

To tidy up later:

- Type aliased `Middleware` (see Alice)
- Created a builder pattern for an array of Middleware
- A little duplication is better than a little dependency
- Empy interface `interface{}` - contentious, but gets around type safety
- Can use `context.WithValue()` to pass context between middleware
- Effective Go
- Go `codegen` - go check out
