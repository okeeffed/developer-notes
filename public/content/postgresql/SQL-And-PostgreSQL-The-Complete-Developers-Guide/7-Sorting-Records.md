# 7: Sorting Records

## The Basics of Sorting

```sql
-- Ascending
SELECT *
FROM products
ORDER BY price;

-- Descending
SELECT *
FROM products
ORDER BY price DESC;
```

## Two Variations on Sorting

We can also sort by alphabetical order.

```sql
-- Sort in alphabetical order
SELECT *
FROM products
ORDER BY name;
```

You can also order by multiple different properties in order of declaration.

```sql
SELECT *
FROM products
ORDER BY price, weight;
```

## Offset and Limit

- `OFFSET` skips the first N records.
- `LIMIT` only give first N records of a result.

```sql
SELECT *
FROM products
ORDER BY price, weight
OFFSET 2
LIMIT 3;
```
