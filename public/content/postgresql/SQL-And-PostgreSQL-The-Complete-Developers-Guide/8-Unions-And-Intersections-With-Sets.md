# 8: Unions And Intersections With Sets

## Handling Sets with Union

The `UNION` operator is used to combine two sets.

```sql
(
  SELECT *
FROM products
ORDER BY price DESC
LIMIT 4
)
UNION
(
SELECT *
FROM products
ORDER BY price / weight DESC
LIMIT 4
);
```

It will also only produce unique results. If that is not what we want, we need to use the `UNION ALL` keyword to get the duplicates.

## A Few Notes on Union

- It is not strictly required to use the parentheses but it may be confusing for the database and you might get an error.
- We need the columns and datatypes to be the same.

## Commonalities with Intersect

| Keyword       | Description                                                                                     |
| ------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| UNION         | Join together the results of two queries and remove duplicate rows.                             |
| UNION ALL     | Join together the results of two queries and keep duplicate rows.                               |
| INTERSECT     | Find the rows common in the two queries. Remove duplicates.                                     |
| INTERSECT ALL | Find the rows common in the two queries. Keep duplicates from individual queries.               |
| EXCEPT        | Find rows present in first query but not the second. Remove duplicates from LHS. Order matters. |
| EXCEPT ALL    | Find rows present in first query but not the second. Keep duplicates from LHS. Order matters.   |
