# Regular and irregular verbs

## Resources

1. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_and_irregular_verbs)

## Definition

A regular verb is any verb whose conjugation follows the typical pattern, or one of the typical patterns, of the language to which it belongs.

A verb whose conjugation follows a different pattern is called an irregular verb.

## Examples

In English, for example, verbs such as play, enter, and like are regular since they form their inflected parts by adding the typical endings -s, -ing and -ed to give forms such as plays, entering, and liked.

On the other hand, verbs such as drink, hit and have are irregular since some of their parts are not made according to the typical pattern: drank and drunk (not "drinked"); hit (as past tense and past participle, not "hitted") and has and had (not "haves" and "haved").
