## Introduction

Verb conjugation is when a verb changes based on a different personm tense, number or mood.

## Person conjugations

In English, we have six different persons: first person singular (I), second person singular (you), third person singular (he/she/it/one), first person plural (we), second person plural (you), and third person plural (they).

## Tense

Verb tense indicates when the action in a sentence is happening (e.g., in the present, future, or past).

Regular verbs follow a standard pattern when conjugated according to tense, while irregular verbs do not.

## Tense Simple Forms

- Present tense expresses an unchanging, repeated, or reoccurring action or situation that exists only now. It can also represent a widespread truth.
- Past tense expresses an action or situation that was started and finished in the past. Most past tense verbs end in `-ed`. The irregular verbs have special past tense forms which must be memorized.
- Future tense expresses an action or situation that will occur in the future. This tense is formed by using `will/shall` with the simple form of the verb.

## Tense Progressive/Continuous Forms

- Present progressive tense describes an ongoing action that is happening at the same time the statement is written. This tense is formed by using `am/is/are` with the verb form ending in `-ing`.
- Past progressive tense describes a past action which was happening when another action occurred. This tense is formed by using `was/were` with the verb form ending in `-ing`.
- Future progressive tense describes an ongoing or continuous action that will take place in the future. This tense is formed by using `will be` or `shall be` with the verb form ending in `-ing`.

## Perfect Forms

- Present perfect tense describes an action that happened at an indefinite time in the past or that began in the past and continues in the present. This tense is formed by using `has/have` with the past participle of the verb. Most past participles end in `-ed`. Irregular verbs have special past participles that must be memorized.
- Past perfect tense describes an action that took place in the past before another past action. This tense is formed by using had with the past participle of the verb.
- Future perfect tense describes an action that will occur in the future before some other action. This tense is formed by using `will have` with the past participle of the verb.

## Perfect Progressive/Continous Forms

- Present perfect progressive tense describes an action that began in the past, continues in the present, and may continue into the future. This tense is formed by using `has/have been` and the present participle of the verb (the verb form ending in `-ing`).
- Past perfect progressive tense describes a past, ongoing action that was completed before some other past action. This tense is formed by using `had been` and the present perfect of the verb (the verb form ending in `-ing`).
- Future perfect progressive tense describes a future, ongoing action that will occur before some specified future time. This tense is formed by using `will have been` and the present participle of the verb (the verb form ending in `-ing`).
