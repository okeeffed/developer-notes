## Big-O Notation

Algorithm running times grow at different rates.

Big O doesn’t tell you the speed in seconds. Big O notation lets you compare the number of operations. It tells you how fast the algorithm grows and establishes a worst-case run time.

A simple search on an array takes O(n) times, whereas a binary search would take O(log n) given the nature of (log[2]n).

## Common Big-O Times

Here are five Big O run times that you’ll encounter a lot, sorted from fastest to slowest:

1. `O(log n)`, also known as log time. Example: Binary search.
2. `O(n)`, also known as linear time. Example: Simple search.
3. `O(n * log n)`. Example: A fast sorting algorithm, like quicksort.
4. `O(n2)`. Example: A slow sorting algorithm, like selection sort.
5. `O(n!)`. Example: A really slow algorithm, like the traveling salesperson.

## Big-O Time Complexity from Algorithms

| Algorithm      | Best        | Average     | Worst       |
| -------------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| Selection Sort | Ω(n^2)      | θ(n^2)      | O(n^2)      |
| Bubble Sort    | Ω(n)        | θ(n^2)      | O(n^2)      |
| Insertion Sort | Ω(n)        | θ(n^2)      | O(n^2)      |
| Heap Sort      | Ω(n log(n)) | θ(n log(n)) | O(n log(n)) |
| Quick Sort     | Ω(n log(n)) | θ(n log(n)) | O(n^2)      |
| Merge Sort     | Ω(n log(n)) | θ(n log(n)) | O(n log(n)) |
| Bucket Sort    | Ω(n+k)      | θ(n+k)      | O(n^2)      |
| Radix Sort     | Ω(nk)       | θ(nk)       | O(nk)       |
