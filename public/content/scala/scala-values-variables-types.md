# Scala Values, Variables and Types

The presumes you have Scala installed on the local system.

This is just the basics on declaring variables in Scala and what data types are available.

## Declaring Variables

Create file `src/main/scala/Playground.scala` with the following.

```scala
object Playground extends App {
  val x: Int = 42
  println(x)
}
```

- `println` will allow us to print to the console.
- Extending `App` allows us to run the file in the command line correctly.
- `val` are immutable - this is the Scala and functional programming way.

Say we remove the explicit type:

```scala
object Playground extends App {
  val x = 42
  println(x)
}
```

This still works as the compiler infers the type to be an `Int`.

## Declaring various types

Below we will run through a declaration of each type.

```scala
object Playground extends App {
  val x: Int = 42
  val y: String = "Hello, Friend!"
  val z: Boolean = true
  val a: Char = 'a' // Note single quotes
  val b: Short = 1234
  val c: Long = 1234123412341234L // Note the L - similar to Java longs
  val d: Float = 2.0f // Note the f - similar to Java
  val e: Double = 2.14 // No marker needed

  /* in order to mutate a variable */
  var f: Int = 1
  f = 2 // this is known as a side effect
}
```

Note that the `val` and `var` keywords have different meanings. `val` is a constant and follows functional, immutable conventions while `var` is mutable and changing a mutable variable is known as a side effect.
