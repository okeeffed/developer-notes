# Welcome

## Resources

## Getting Started

> As an important note for anyone who comes across this: they will be my personal notes and I refuse to copy across Kent's hard work. Go to EpicReact.dev and support his work. Any examples that come across into my open source notes will be applications of what I learn in the course.

Key notes:

- A bunch of interactivity.
- Online learning courses.

## Project READMEs and Prerequisites

Open sourced - the relevant repo will show up in the course. There are pre-requisites for each workshop.

## Clone and Setup

Basically, when you are where you want to be:

```s
git clone https://github.com/kentcdodds/<module-name>.git
cd <module-name>
npm run setup --silent
```

I just wrote a script to do this.

```s
#!/bin/bash
git clone https://github.com/kentcdodds/$1.git
cd $1
npm run setup --silent
```

## Running

```s
npm start
```

## Tests

```s
# npm t works as well
npm test
```
