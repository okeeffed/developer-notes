# Collections & Iterators

When we talk about iterators we mean we have more than one thing and we want to iterate through that collection and do something.

## Immutability

If you've used `Array.push`, or `Array.splice`, etc. they are mutable methods that update the object at the memory pointer.

Why does this matter? There are a couple of reasons, but an important one: In JS, it garbage collects on memory pointers. If you want to evaluate if it has changed or not, you need to evaluate based on properties if it was a mutable object pointing to the same space.

A useful tidbit that came out was the `Object.freeze` method to prevent mutablility.

When it comes to managing state, control flow and code volume, there are few things more elegant than reducers.
