# Developer Notes

A list of developer notes over the years by [Dennis O'Keeffe](https://dennisokeeffe.com).

These are my own personal notes and not necessarily formatted to please anyone in particular - just to help refresh my mind under the right scenario.

Note that some of these notes also cover old courses I have undertaken. If those notes are of use to you, please consider finding the original resource and contributing.

## Running locally

Pull the repo and run `npm install`. Start with `npm run dev`.

```s
$ npm install
# ... wait for deps to install
$ npm run dev
# ... nextjs output
```

## Future

I will continue adding new notes as I continue learning.

Some of these notes are getting old or are badly formatted. I plan on updating those as they become relevant.

## Contributing

These are personal notes, so I will probably keep it that way.
