## What to know about LoFi

- Beats are "off the grid" - not-so quantised and with swing.
- Grit is good: add satuation, distortion and roll off the high ends (as if pulled of the record).
- Add in some vinyl effects, etc.
- Want it to sound like it is coming off analog gear: lots of distortion, bit-crushing, etc. and not super pristine.
- Not many elements. Might "seem empty" but you add atmosphere, characters etc. through the elements.

> "Know the rules before you can break them." - advice on LoFi.

## LoFi Melody

- Jazzy gears.
- Normally a loop.
- Warped and chopped up.
- Old soul records. You can hide other record drums etc. with a few techniques.

## Melody Effects

There is an an effect rack that comes with the tutorial that helps with adding some basic elements. It is used for the piano sound.

## Melody Chops

Chopping up the loop.

- Look for filler notes and parts for the end of a measure.
- Add big melody pieces.

> Right click and slice to new midi track.

## Drums overview

- Not about being synchronised on the grid - intentional bop and swing. Feel a bit late.
- Snares with highs rolled off and rimshots. Not really crisp. Mainly acoustic. Need a real element.
- Drum patterns are not very complicated. Very similar across the board.
- Can't hide under trap snares. Could be a simple 18th note high hat (or even less).
