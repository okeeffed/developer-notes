# Kevin Yank Talk

## Overview

- Virtual DOM like React
- State management like Redux
- Strongly typed
- Immutable
- No runtime errors

## Suprises/Pain Points

### Surprises 

1. CSS Modules in Elm
2. Infrequent releases
3. Team adoption

### Pain Points

1. Compiler performance
2. Large SPAs
3. DOM is off-limits

## CSS Modules in Elm

`elm-css-modules-loader` OS from CA.

## Compiler Performance

- The more written, the slower the compilation.
- Speed based on place in dependency tree. 0.19 release helped with these pain points.

## Infrequent Releases

Self-explanatory.

## Large SPAs

Bundle size growing proportional to dependencies.
