### Overview

The hierarchy is on the left side of the screen. It's the list of objects in the scene.

The bottom part is full of the assets.

The main screen has the `scene` and `game` views that allow you to see different perspectives.

There are also a number of different preset values that you can use as well.

You can also use the tab and drag to rearrange the view.

### Scene View - Navigation and Positioning

A quick navigation is to right click and use the arrows to move around. You can also use the mouse to change the direction of view.

`F` key after selecting an object will focus in on the object.

You can orbit by holding `alt` and dragging.
