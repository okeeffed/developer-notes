# Setting up a Shopify dev store

## Setting up the store

1. Log into the [Shopify parter website](https://partners.shopify.com/).
2. On the left-hand side bar, head to `Stores`.
3. Click `Add store`.
4. Follow the prompts.

## Connecting to your store

Before this, ensure that you have added a new product.

```sh
$ npx create-next-app shopify-storefront -e with-typescript
# ... creates storefront
$ cd shopify-storefront
$ touch utils/shopify.ts
```

In `utils/shopify.ts`, add the following:

```ts
import Client from "shopify-buy"

export const client = Client.buildClient({
  storefrontAccessToken: process.env.SHOPIFY_STORE_FRONT_ACCESS_TOKEN,
  domain: process.env.SHOPIFY_STORE_DOMAIN,
})
```

At this stage, you will need to create an app on your store admin page.

Within the app, set all `Storefront API` permissions.
