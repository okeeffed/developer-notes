# Writing With Flair

## Purpose Of Writing

- Conveying information.
- To entertain.
- To persuade.
- To inspire.

### The Mindset Of Elite Writing

- Really think if this is the right word, necessary word etc. - this is the attention to detail that you need.
- No needless words - you want to communicate, not impress.
- Presentation of work should be slick and consistent.

### The Secret Sauce Of Flair

1. Simplicity 
2. Clarity 
3. Elegance

## 1. Simplicity

### 1.1 Economy

Use shorter words unless there is a need for precision. Shorter words help quicken comprehension. When to break that rule? Avoiding repetition, adding rhythm and where the is a real distinction between the choice of two words.

A good journalist will use the fewest words possible to convey a thought.

A useful maxim: ***Any word that can go, must go.***

### 1.2 Repetition 

Within a piece of work, the same point is made. Reduction is required.

### 1.3 Overcomplicating Things

Making simple points sound more complex than they are. Simplify as much as possible.
