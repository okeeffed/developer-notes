# Handling Diff in Days

This came up as there were strange differences of < 24 hours causing issues when you would only diff based on the differences of that size. The following enforces a guess of the userâ€™s timezone, then to use that timezone against the start of each respective day to calculate the expected integer difference.

An example, 9pm today and 1pm tomorrow will still return `1`, while 9pm today and 11pm today will still return `0`.

```javascript
// This attempts to guess the local users timezone,
// changes the time to the start of the day based on that
// local timezone and finally calculates the difference that way.
// This ensures differences, for example less than 24 hours,
// but on different days are still calculated to have
// a difference of one day and for those on the same day
// to come up with zero etc.
return moment(date)
  .tz(moment.tz.guess())
  .startOf('day')
  .diff(
    moment()
      .tz(moment.tz.guess())
      .startOf('day'),
    'days',
  );
```
