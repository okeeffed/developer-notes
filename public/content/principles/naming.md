# Naming

## Components

Component naming should as swiftly as possible inform the following:

1.  Type
2.  Area/region in the app/site
3.  Purpose
4.  Context

To do it in such a way that is purposeful and scalable, consider following the naming by going `[Type][Region][Purpose][Context]`.

### Deep dive

For example, let's take the unknown customer journey . In this flow, they go from home, cover the common basics between the customer journeys for identifying if they are a member, the store location, the order and the type before moving on to the specific journey feedback. When building out the individual pages, we can determine and define a type, region, purpose and context.

```javascript
// [Type][Region][Purpose][Context]
1. PageHome // -> selects "Leave Feedback"
2. PageBaseIsMember // -> Type: Page, region: Base, purpose: Is, context: Member, selects no
3. PageBaseSetStore // -> Type: Page, region: Base, purpose: Set, context: Store, selects continue
4. PageBaseSetOrderType // -> Type: Page, region: Base, purpose: Set, context: Order Type
// etc
```

Note that you can emit `purpose` and `context` from the name if it is not relevant.

Within each page, you can individual components. Try to use the class name convention to generate the names for child components:

```javascript
// ! This is just an example and not necessarily
// reflective of actual use. Use your own discression.
<PageBaseSetOrderType>
  // Compoent for each order type
  <ComponentOrderTypeRadio />
  <ComponentOrderTypeRadio />
  <ComponentOrderTypeRadio />
  <ComponentOrderTypeRadio />
</PageBaseSetOrderType>
```

## Class Names

Try follow the convention below for naming classes.

```yml
body:
  header: # @classname header
    # @children
  # Top level for each section
  section: # @classname section-name
    # @children
    container: # @classname container-name
      # Base selection of rules
      ? block
      # @children
      grid:
        ? grid-item
        # @children
      table:
        # @children
        table-header:
          # @children
        table-data:
          # @chidlren
      list:
        # react native only
        list-item:
          # @children
      # ... more, maybe article etc
      nav:
        nav-item:
          # @children
  component: # @classname component-name
    # Specific component based styling
    # @children
    # Base selection of rules
    ? block
    # @children
    grid:
      ? grid-item
      # @children
    table:
      # @children
      table-header:
        # @children
      table-data:
        # @chidlren
    list:
      # react native only
      list-item:
        # @children
    # ... more, maybe article etc
    nav:
      nav-item:
        # @children
  footer: # @classname footer - but maybe should be more specific
    # @children
```
