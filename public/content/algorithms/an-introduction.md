# An Introduction

## Tips and tricks

1. READ THE QUESTION THOROUGHLY
2. Use hashmaps for O(1).
3. For array sorted, run O(n) with sorting by index swaps and not other options (like selection sort).
4. To find the midpoint of linked lists or something you cannot use length for, use the two pointers and iterate +1, +2 respectively and don't iterate through the entire list.
5. Use Regexes wisely.
6. Understand converting and iterating through strings (ie understand types, side effects of casting etc)
