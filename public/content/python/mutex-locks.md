# Mutex Locks

## Example

```python
"""
This is a short example demoing how it works, but this example isn't realistic.

Worth thinking about when using thread pools though and accessing shared resources.
"""
import random
import csv
import threading
lock = threading.Lock()

sum = 0
data = list(range(1000))

for element in data:
  with locks:
    sum += element
```
