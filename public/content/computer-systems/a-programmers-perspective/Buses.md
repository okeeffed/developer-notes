# Buses
A collection of electrical conduits that carry bytes of information back and forth between the components.

Typically designed to transfer fixed-size chunks of bytes know as *words*. The number of bytes in a word is a fundamental system parameter that varies across systems.

> Most machines has a word size of either 4 bytes (32-bit) or 8 bytes (64-bit).

## Alternative defintion
Buses are subsystems that that are used to connect computer components and transfer data between them.

As an example, an internal bus connects computer internals to the motherboard.

A bus may be **parallel** or **serial**. 

- Parallel busses transmit data across multiple wires.
- Serial buses transmit data in bit-serial format.
