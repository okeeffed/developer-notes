# Processes

- A process is an OS abstraction for running a program.
- Multiple processes can run on the same system, and "appear" to have exclusive use of the hardware.
	- Concurrently: Instructions of one process are interleaved with another.
	- The interleaving occurs with a mechanism called **context switching**.
