Scenario: functional architect is giving invalid functional requirements.

- Find the reason
- Try to restore the personal power to the FA
- Escalate up if needed

Scenario: Optimistic project manager

- Bring PM in on the dev team
- Find the reason: Optimistic PM, naive LD, slow devs?
- Coach LD/restructure devs/readjust schedule/alter planning
