## Using the bang (!)

From [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/a/612196)

> In general, methods that end in ! indicate that the method will modify the object it's called on. Ruby calls these as "dangerous methods" because they change state that someone else might have a reference to.

```ruby
foo = "A STRING"  # a string called foo
foo.downcase!     # modifies foo itself
puts foo          # prints modified foo
# 'a string'
```

In the standard library, there are lots of places where you will see a call with the `!` and without. These are referred to as "safe methods", and return a copy of the original with changes applied to the copy.

```ruby
foo = "A STRING"    # a string called foo
bar = foo.downcase  # doesn't modify foo; returns a modified string
puts foo            # prints unchanged foo
# A STRING
puts bar            # prints newly created bar
# a string
```

**Keep in mind this is just a convention, but a lot of Ruby classes follow it.**

Bang is also used for methods that raise an exception when the method without does not, e.g.: save and save! in ActiveRecord.

> The exclamation point means many things, and sometimes you can't tell a lot from it other than "this is dangerous, be careful". Other libraries may use it differently. In Rails an exclamation point often means that the method will throw an exception on failure rather than failing silently.
