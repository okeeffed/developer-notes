# React Best Practices 2021

## Rendering

1. Does the component support handling of a state under an enum `status`?
2. Is there an error boundary to handle unexpected issues?
3. Should the state be colocated?
4. If using context, is the provider optimised to prevent re-renders?
5. Are expensive initial state calculations lazy initialized?
6. Does an expensive calculation require `React.useMemo`?
7. Does an expensive component (due to large list or other) require memoisation?

## Hooks

1. Should the hook be abstracted?

## Testing

1. Does the test avoid implementation details?
2. Do you need to [test the hook](https://github.com/testing-library/react-hooks-testing-library#when-to-use-this-library)?
3. Are you validating the UI by the [recommended order](https://testing-library.com/docs/queries/about/#priority)?
