## Properties of Algebra

### Commutative Property of Algebra

Definition:

1. involving the condition that a group of quantities connected by operators gives the same result whatever the order of the quantities involved, e.g. a × b = b × a.
2. relating to or involving substitution or exchange.

<BlockMath math="a + b = 7 + 2 = 9"/>
<BlockMath math="b + a = 2 + 7 = 9"/>

### Associativity Property of Algebra

Grouping of more than two numbers to perform basic aritmetic operations of addition/multiplication does not affect the final result.

<BlockMath math="(a + b) + c = (-2 + 4) + 5 = 7"/>
<BlockMath math="a + (b + c) = -2 + (4 + 5) = 7"/>

### Distributive Property of Algebra

The distributive property defines that the product of a single term and a sum or difference of two or more terms inside the bracket is same as multiplying each addend by the single term and then adding or subtracting the products.

<BlockMath math="(a + b) \cdot c = a \cdot c + b \cdot c"/>
<BlockMath math="a \cdot (b + c) = a \cdot b + a \cdot c"/>

### Additive Identity Property

<BlockMath math="a = a + 0"/>

### Multiplicative Identity Property

<BlockMath math="a = a \cdot 1 = 1 \cdot a"/>

### Additive Inverse Property

<BlockMath math="a + (-a) = 0 = (-a) + a"/>

### Multiplicative Inverse Property

<BlockMath math="2 \cdot \frac{1}{2} = 0 = \frac{1}{2} \cdot 2"/>

## Logarithmic Properties

### Product Rule

The log of a product is equal to the sum of the log of the first base and the log of the second base:

<BlockMath math="\log_b (xy) = \log_b x + \log_b y"/>

### Quotient Rule

The log of a quotient is equal to the difference of the logs of the numerator and denominator:

<BlockMath math="\log_b (x/y) = \log_b x - \log_b y"/>

### Power Rule

The log of a power is equal to the power times the log of the base:

<BlockMath math="\log_b (x^n) = n \log_b x"/>

### Change of Base Formula

The log of a new base is the log of the new base divided by the log of the old base in the new base:

<BlockMath math="\log_b x = \log_a x / \log_a b"/>

### Base Switch Rule

<BlockMath math="\log_b x = \frac{1}{\log_x b}"/>
