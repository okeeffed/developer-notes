# 3: Advanced Techniques

## Custom models with Blender

This section will learn the basics of blender.

When opening blender, we generally want to create a standard new file.

### Areas

By default, we get a 3D area as the main section. The timeline is down the bottom. The outliner on the right and the properties area.

On the top-left of the timeline view to something else. The example does a second 3D viewport.

We can also create new areas. The example splits the timeline into two sides.

### Shortcuts

Here's a [non-exhaustive list of shortcuts](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wZzJrEgNye2ZQqwe8oBh54AXwF5cYIe56EGFe2bb0QU/edit?usp=sharing).

One of the strengths of Blender is its shortcuts. There are tons of them, and once you master the basics, you can be very efficient. Don't worry; you can use all the shortcut actions through the interface or with the search panel that we will see later. Throughout this lesson, we will discover some of the more critical shortcuts.
