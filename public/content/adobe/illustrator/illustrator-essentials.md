1. [SkillShare class](https://www.skillshare.com/classes/Adobe-Illustrator-CC-%E2%80%93-Essentials-Training/1986526776/projects)

## Pre-Course Notes

There are both exercise and completed files.

Cheat sheets (and PDF) are also available. (`bringyourownlaptop.com`)

## Getting started

There is a `Getting Started` exercise file that you can open.

The request is to reset the sidebar to `Essentials` (and reset them).

Some handy shortcuts that came up:

| Command           | Does                        |
| ----------------- | --------------------------- |
| `v`               | Selection tool              |
| `a`               | Direct selection tool       |
| `z`               | Zoom tool                   |
| `+` or `-`        | Zoom in/out                 |
| `Spacebar`        | Grab and move things around |
| `Shift + o`       | Artboard tool               |
| `Shift + Cmd + p` | Place                       |

> Note: You can have more than one page (artboard).

If you double click and things gray out, you are likely in isolation mode.

## Drawing shapes and lines

We want to first use "place" to import a image file to be used as the example layer.

## Shape builder

You can use the shape builder to combine/subtract shapes.

> Hold `alt` down with the tool.

## Other tips and tidbits from the course

- Shape design tool is your friend.
- `Effects` is a great way to add effects such as brush strokes.

## Width tool

- `option` to move one side.
- Can change the anchor along a path.
- Click and pull to open the width at that point.
- Make sure the edge is as thin as possible before opening the width.

## Types & Fonts

- The is a point-type box and a second area-type type box.
- We can also type along a path.
- We can break apart and distort text by converting a text into outlines and using the `Direct Selection tool`.

## Colors

- RGB vs CMYK: most of the time you will want to represent things using RGB.
- We can use the color picker to get image colors.
- `Window > Color theme` and click explore to see some. This is being deprecated though, so you can go to [Adobe Colors](https://color.adobe.com/). Use the `Graident tool` to edit.
- There is a cool website for gradients call [Grabient](https://www.grabient.com/).
- You can aso do gradients by text.

## Masking

- You can mask the images by using a mask.
- For complicated images you want to mask, you need to make shapes into a `compound path` first and then it can operated as a mask on an image.

## CC Libraries

`Libraries` on the right hand panel allows you to do many things.

- Libraries are cross-app (you can put them in Illustrator, Photoshop, etc).
- Drag + drop saved assets with `option` on Mac to "unlink" the assets from the library and edit without changing the library.

## Finding fonts

Go to `typekit.com` and pass in a screenshot.
