title: Lesson 4 - Binary Representation of Numbers and Letters
---

# Summary

Carrie Anne explains how computers represent numbers and letters using binary, covering the basics of binary math, ASCII, and Unicode.

## Highlights

- **🔢 Binary Representation:** Computers represent values using binary (1s and 0s) for efficient data storage.
- **✖️ Binary Math:** Binary math operates similarly to decimal, with each bit having a power of two multiplier.
- **💾 Byte Structure:** A byte consists of 8 bits, allowing for 256 different values.
- **🌍 ASCII Limitations:** ASCII allows text representation but is limited in language support.
- **🌐 Unicode's Universality:** Unicode offers a universal encoding scheme for all characters, accommodating diverse languages.
- **🎶 Multimedia Encoding:** Binary sequences also encode multimedia formats like MP3s and GIFs.
- **💻 Upcoming Topics:** Next week, the series will explore how computers manipulate these binary sequences.

## Key Insights

- **🔍 Binary Representation:** Binary is foundational in computing, using only two states (0 and 1) to represent all forms of data. This simplicity allows for complex data handling and storage.
- **⚖️ Binary vs. Decimal:** While decimal uses base-10, binary operates on base-2, showing that number systems can vary in structure yet perform similar functions.
- **🧩 Significance of Bytes:** With 8 bits in a byte, computers can represent a range of values, which is crucial for graphics and audio, reflecting the importance of bit depth in technology.
- **🗣️ Limitations of ASCII:** ASCII’s focus on English restricts its usability in global contexts, highlighting the need for more inclusive encoding methods.
- **📜 Advent of Unicode:** Unicode’s creation allows for seamless communication across languages, resolving issues of compatibility and representation in the digital age.
- **🎨 Data Encoding in Multimedia:** Binary isn’t just for numbers; it also encodes various formats, illustrating the versatility of binary in technology.
- **🔄 Future Computation:** Understanding binary is essential for grasping how computers perform calculations, setting the stage for deeper exploration of computation.
