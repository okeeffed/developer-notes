# Developer Notes

A list of developer notes over the years by Dennis O'Keeffe.

These are my own personal notes and not necessarily formatted to please anyone in particular - just to help refresh my mind under the right scenario.

Note that some of these notes also cover old courses I have undertaken. If those notes are of use to you, please consider finding the original resource and contributing.

## Published

You can find these notes quickly thrown together using Docz here https://docs.dennisokeeffe.com/

## Note

Some of the incredibly long markdown files having issues loading with Docz. Over time I will break those files down into smaller components as a fix.

## Running locally

Pull the repo and run `yarn install`. This repo using `docz` and there are two npm scripts to help you run local development and build the repo.

```json
"scripts": {
    "start": "yarn docz dev",
    "build": "docz build"
}
```

## Future

I will continue adding new notes as I continue learning.

Given that `docz` supports `mdx`, I will likely begin adding in some React components where relevant to help with more interactive learning.

Some of these notes are getting old or are badly formatted. I plan on updating those as they become relevant.

## Contributing

Feel free to contribute. Make a pull request and I will double check you aren't spreading anything malicious to the humans of planet Earth.
