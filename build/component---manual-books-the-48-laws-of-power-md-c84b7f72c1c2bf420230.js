Always seem patient, as if you know that everything will come to you eventually. Become a detective of the right moment; sniff out the spirit of the times, the trends that will carry you to power. Learn to stand back when the time is not yet ripe, and to strike fiercely when it has reached fruition."),Object(o.b)("h2",{id:"law-36-disdain-things-you-cannot-have-ignoring-them-is-the-best-revenge"},"Law 36: Disdain things you cannot have: ignoring them is the best revenge."),Object(o.b)("p",null,"By acknowledging a petty problem you give it existence and credibility. The more attention you pay an enemy, the stronger you make him; and a small mistake is often made worse and more visible when you try to fix it. It is sometimes best to leave things alone.
