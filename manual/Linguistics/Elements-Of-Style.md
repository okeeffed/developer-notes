| Perspective   | Examples               |

## Modifiers

Should be place next to the word they modify when possible.

- Don't: All the teachers were not present.
- Do: Not all the teachers were present.

## Conditions

Place long conditions after the main clause.

- Don't: If you own more than fifty acres and cultivate grapes, you are subject to water rationing.
- Do: You are subject to water rationing if you own more than 50 acres and cultivate grapes.

## Word Clutter

### Intruders

Intruders are a type of word clutter that add nothing to the sentence:

- Don't: Paper records are endangered by fluctuating weather conditions.
- Do: Paper records are endangered by fluctuating weather.

### Redundancy

Adding unnecessary words that repeat the same thing.

- Don't: The roof was partially destroyed by the cyclone.
- Do: The roof was damaged by the cyclone.

## Grammar

### Noun

A word to identify any of a class of people, places, things (common) or a particular name of one of these (proper).

### Pronoun

A word that replaces a noun. Instead of "Sam likes pizza", using "He likes pizza" would have the pronoun "he".

### Preposition

Shows relationship between a noun or pronoun and some other word in the sentence. The relationship is spatial, temporal or directional. "I walked towards the house" would have "towards" as the proposition as it shows direction. When linked with noun or pronouns, it creates a "prepositional phrase" -- the example being "towards the house".

### Conjunction

Used to link words or parts of a sentence together. There are four types: coordinating (for, and, nor, but, or, yet, so), subordinating (after, as, although, once), adverb (furthermore, consequently, moreover) and correlative (both...and).

### Interjection

A word added to sentence to convey emotion and is not grammatically related to any other part of the sentence. Example "Wow!". Should be avoided in academic and professional writing.

### Adjective

Descriptively modifies a noun of pronoun. "I am a tall, skinny man" would use two adjectives "tall" and "skinny".

### Articles

Articles include "a", "an" and "the".

### Verbs

The "doing" words. They show action. They are at heart of compelling writing.

### Adverb

Similar to adjectives, the adverb modifies a verb, an adjective or another adverb. "I walked slowly towards the door" would have "slowly" as the adverb.

### Infinitives

A verb form that almost always begins with the word "to" and ends with a simple verb.

Examples include "to walk", "to run", "to swim".

### Gerunds

Verbs ended in `-ing` and functioning as a noun.

Examples include "Jumping is fun", "He liked skiing", and "He had a unique way of whistling".

### Participles

Verbs ending in `-ing` (present participle) or `-ed`, `-d`, `-t`, `-en`, `-n` (past participle).

Examples include "The dancing parrots entertained the crowd.", "The wrecked sailboat washed up on shore.".

### Transitive, Intransitive and Ditransitive verbs

A transitive verb takes a direct object; that is, the verb transmits action to an object:

- He _sent_ the _letter_ (letter = direct object of sent).
- She _gave_ the _lecture_ (lecture = direct object of gave).

An intranstive verb does not take an object:

- She _sleeps_ too much.
- He _complains_ too much.
- He is _sleeping_.

Ditransitive verbs is one that takes both a direct object and indirect objects.

- He _gave_ _her_ the _letter_ (letter = direct object, her = indirect object).
