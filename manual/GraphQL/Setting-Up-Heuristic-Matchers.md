# Setting Up Heuristic Matchers

## Resources

1. [Fragment Matcher - GraphQL Code Generator](https://graphql-code-generator.com/docs/plugins/fragment-matcher)
2. [TypeScript - GraphQL Code Generator](https://graphql-code-generator.com/docs/plugins/typescript)
3. [Apollo Client - Using fragments](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/data/fragments/)

## The issue

With Apollo Client, you need to do some extra setup to get Apollo to place nice with heurstics based on unions. If not, it will fail based on a heuristic missing pieces of data.

This results in the error state being thrown by the client.

In order to resolve this, it requires us to install a few pieces of work.

## Installation

```shell
yarn add -D @graphql-codegen/cli @graphql-codegen/fragment-matcher
```

Add `graphql-codegen` to npm scripts.

Ensure you are using `@apollo/client` and drop `@apollo/react-hooks` as it is included now (see the GitHub issue [here](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-client/issues/5808)).

This also means ensuring imports for the `ApolloProvider` and other hooks come from `@apollo/client`.

## Setup for Apollo Client

With Apollo Client 3, you'll need to make the following changes to your current file that sets up the client:

```javascript
import {
  InMemoryCache,
  IntrospectionFragmentMatcher,
} from 'apollo-cache-inmemory';

// generated by Fragment Matcher plugin
import possibleTypes from '../introspection-result';

const cache = new InMemoryCache({
  possibleTypes,
});
```

## Codegen

Create a `codegen.yml` file with some config options:

```yml
# codegen.yml
schema: http://localhost:7000/performance/api/v2/graphql
overwrite: true
generates:
  ./src/introspection-result.ts:
    plugins:
      - fragment-matcher
```

Run `yarn codegen` to generate the schema.

## In Action

When all of this is done, you will be able to query your data with no warnings or errors!
