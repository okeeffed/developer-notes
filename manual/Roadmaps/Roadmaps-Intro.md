# Intro to Roadmaps

This is a list of roadmaps to follow to master a particular field.

## Resources

1. [Awesome Roadmaps](https://github.com/liuchong/awesome-roadmaps)
2. [Data Science Roadmaps](https://github.com/hasbrain/data-science-roadmap)
3. [Software Design + Architecture Roadmaps](https://github.com/stemmlerjs/software-design-and-architecture-roadmap)
4. [Developer Roadmap](https://github.com/kamranahmedse/developer-roadmap)
5. [Online Developer Roadmap](https://roadmap.sh/)
6. [GoLang Roadmap](https://github.com/Alikhll/golang-developer-roadmap)

The plan is the find answers for all of the roadmap segments and study them thoroughly.
